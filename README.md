## How do I use the code myself?
**Note: you need an Arduino Leonardo, Arduino Micro or any Arduino clone that is based on ATmega32u4 to use this code.**

After downloading and setting up Git Bash and Arduino IDE, We are ready to upload our code to our arduino.

1. Go to the directory which you want to clone in and clone the repository with the following command.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Scorpions-Robotics/Leonardo-Joystick
```
2. Start the Arduino IDE, open the buttons.ino file.
3. Go to tools section from menu and choose the correct board and port.
4. Click the upload button and good job, you're done!

You can see some other examples for the library at [this repository](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary).

## Issues
If you're facing with any kind of problem while using the code, feel free to open an issue. Good luck!
